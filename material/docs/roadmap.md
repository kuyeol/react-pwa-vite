This roadmap describes current, future, and past goals for Material Web
Components.

<!--#include file="../googlers/roadmap.md" -->

## Current

### Build new components

*Planned for 2024*

One of our core goals is to provide Material Design components for the web.
These are the components we are currently working on.

*   Card
*   Navigation drawer
*   Snackbar

### Expand Material Design tokens

*Planned for Q1 2024*

We are adding shape and motion system tokens to support building expressive
Material experiences.

We also want to make it easier to use Material Design tokens, such as applying
Material typescale, shape, and color to your own components.

### Create TSX components

*Planned for Q1 2024*

[TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) is a popular
language extension for frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/). We want to
make it easier and more seamless to use Material Web Components in TSX.

### Follow accessibility best practices

*Planned for Q2 2024*

Everyone should be able to access and enjoy the web. We want our components to
help others build accessible experiences.

We are working on supporting all of the following screen readers:

*   VoiceOver
*   Talkback
*   ChromeVox
*   JAWS
*   NVDA

### Explore Material Design layouts

*Planned for Q4 2024*

Components are only part of the story to build fully expressive Material Design
applications. We want to explore ways to support building applications that
follow
[Material's layout patterns](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/overview).

## Future

### Planned new components

These are components we want to build next.

*   Autocomplete
*   Badge
*   Banner
*   Bottom app bar
*   Bottom sheet
*   Data table
*   Date picker
*   Navigation bar
*   Navigation rail
*   Search
*   Segmented button
*   Time picker
*   Top app bar
*   Tooltip

### Density and spacing tokens

Density allows components to take up less vertical space for larger displays.
While we have some spacing tokens already, we need a comprehensive spacing
system to fully support density across components.

## Past
