# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! The following sections describe
ways to get involved.

## Code of conduct

Please review and follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Feedback

User feedback is the most valuable to us. It's a great way to start
contributing!

-   [File new issues](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/new/choose)
    for bugs you run into or feature requests you have.

-   [Create a discussion](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/new/choose)
    for help, feedback on changes, or feature proposals.

## Discord

Join the `#material` channel on [Lit's Discord](https://lit.dev/discord) to chat
directly with the team and other users.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome! Keep a few things in mind:

-   Create an
    [issue](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/issues/new/choose)
    or
    [discussion](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/new/choose)
    before opening a pull request.
-   Trivial changes, such as documentation, don't need an issue.
-   Create draft PRs in the `@material/web/labs` folder for new features.
-   Please be patient! It may take a while for the team to review. Keep changes
    small and scoped to speed things up.

### New components

Please understand that new component implementations are difficult for us to
directly accept. They need to complete several engineer, design, and
accessibility reviews that are not easy with our externally available workflows.

If you want to help build a new component, create a
[new discussion](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/new/choose).
Add any design docs, code samples, reference implementations in draft PRs, and
get community feedback.
